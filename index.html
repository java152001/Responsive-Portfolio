            <p>Hi there everyone.  My name is Anthony Demott.  I was born in Illinois and raised in a desert wasteland called Tucson, AZ.  I'm 29 years old and graduated from University High School in 2007.  I'm a hobbyist carpenter and lifetime tinkerer. </p>

            <p>Currently I work as an operations supervisor at a collections company called iQor.  I have worked there for 11 years and gradually moved my way up the totem pole of the corporate chain.  I manage 25 people directly, making sure they're the happiest most productive employees possible.</p>

            <p>I'm very excited and passionate about this boot camp.  I'm working everyday to ensure that I understand the fundamentals and whys of everything that we go over.  I really want to turn this into a career as it's something that I'm good at and know I will enjoy doing!</p>
